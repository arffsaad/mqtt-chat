# MQTT Chat App

### > Relatively dumb and useless but I did it anyway. This chat app resembles the old school messenger apps. with some sounds as well.

### To setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### To use it:
1. You will need an MQTT Broker (use test.mosquitto.org if you dont have one. It uses the default 1883 port.)
2. Set any random number as the ChatID (your friends, if you have any, must use the same one as well)
3. Connect. You may start sending messages after that.
